 I think we've been facing. I'm not gonna be an aerial person this game. You're going to be like dodging. I do that. I like double jump. Challenge or live the place. Yeah, you'll be fine. You're the only time you're gonna worry about it is if you're deciding to like try it. Yeah, so that's gonna work for you. Great. Excel. Can we handle it? Don't know. I think I would be able to, but I'm not sure you will. Um, we'll skip a B save. Oh, oh, oh, like. Okay, now I'm glad I didn't hit that. Now, I'm on file. I'm the barrel. So he's gonna be in the noise. I'm trying to say a life. I'm trying to say a life. I got it. I'm gonna very fast the fire. So I was just trying to slide around and. I was trying to start my ability at him. Oh. Uh, okay. Oh, another amber resin. Triple shot. Triple shot. Triple shot. Triple shot. Oh, yeah. Triple shot. I'm a good triple shot. Amazing healing. Thankfully I have the thingy. So as long as I die right away, I can get some health from it. Oh, okay. Oh, that's nice. I want to give you this sliding. I just realized what it was. But it was not just applying it. It's also hitting you know those grubs. You hate so much. It does a little bit of knockback to them. So you can't actually get you. You probably don't need to jump. You can just slide. Uh, this heavy hitter or trick shot. Could be. Uh, I saw it. It would be okay. I saw it. Yeah, yeah. I should be heavy hitter. I need to help. Maybe I'll get rid of it later. It just increases your damage by. Uh, you'll get a fully damaged. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It increases your damage by. Uh, you know, that's a fully damaged. I want to step down. My cooldowns are a shit though. So you have an idea of what to actually go. It increases your ability power. The damage your ability does by 200 percent. Yeah. You'd like to try it out for, for like a level? Oh my god, it's 14 second cooldown. Yeah, yeah. You have a bouncing ability. Uh, no. I'm only triple. Bouncing ability kind of ruins the electric hour. Unless you're. Because it gives it gravity, which means it will just fall in front of you and bounce. Once and then be gone. Uh, husking. I'm not sure. Okay. it will just fall in front of you and bounce once and then be gone. The sonic players come. I probably won't get the chaos in but I never get any of the bonus cards. Mine hasn't arrived yet. Want to just do random? Yeah, and this is what I mean by the double trail. Yeah, I see that. Benzie, what'd you get? If you made the epic cut, I'll give you a hit. Good change. You could exchange health, fast or money. Uh, um, have many money things right now. I don't think we do. Any eye economy? Biker. Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck. He got me from the air. I'll get it. I will. Holy fuck. Yeah, the fucking bee. It was the firecrackle. I thought maybe dumps me air as a lamp. Oh god, I'm inside fire. I can lower something. The fucking fire. You want to get rid of the- We had an arcade build done. And we can do that again on D. We tried again. We could try it again. This weapon is not the best there. Maybe I'll try. I did like the old launcher. It's every done now. Well, this is set fire so you'll be upgrading again. You can pick whatever you want. I guess I'll pick my favorite one. Yeah, but it's more the base achievements. Out there. What do you want me to do? I'll try the blade one. I'll try the blade launcher. Oxen rifle. None of these are great for me, the ones I have left. I have to get them all on like nightmare or higher, but I guess we're doing set fire. I'll just go to the weapon I like and go from there. Emperor, do you like forbidden? Enjoy your lucky'sæ‹³. I'm going to go save the rest of the room. I need that, too. But I cannot. Meanwhile, I'm going to have a chocolate. That's not my- I don't have a- I'm not going to have a- I'm going to have a- I'm going to have a million damage, too. And just- We'll have it on standby. Just have to get lucky for it, though. It's realistically- I'm just looking for a patch- Oh! The Wimco? Why you Wimco? There's some inside jerk between you and Taylor. You're a wrecked Wimco. You have a Wally Pau. Why you Wimco when you could save Wimco? They keep you guys dying. You're not a Wimco? I didn't get any good ones this time. Do I need these?
