 I'm gonna check something, I can't remember my fucking password. That'll be why no, I can't remember my password. Get the bonk to know. I was just looking at something, cause I think I'm gonna have to reset something up and back from where, maybe. All right. I'll see you, don't open up my view. I've got you for your item. Yeah, I got triple ability. Try what, what ability? The purple one I like. Ooh, double, double. I need to get some good cool down on it. Maybe build up my ability. Are you ready? Let's go. Hello there, it's Poppa Fish. I hate Poppa Fish. Let me get it. I mean, that one can be good. Oh, scavenger's good. All right, no, it's just rush. Yeah, I think we can. We've got some decent new here. The max health, the rocket boss, who would be better. Yeah, fuck yeah. All right, max health, we're up first. All the new ones. Oh, the purple ones are good. Oh, let's go. What do we get? You want to do max health? Hell, I like my health build, especially since I am always getting more hit the new, and this is harder. I think we should agree to raise. Ooh, iron explosions as well. Random shot, ooh. Random shot. Random shot, not iron explosion. What do you think? Ice explosion is good if you have a way to reset your abilities. Otherwise, you're honestly, if random shot is probably the better one. All right, what about these? Really just special delivery, I guess. Do you get, or you have an eye? Ooh, eye can shot. I'm thinking about taking it off. So you get it. What's your, what's your ability? I just, I just, I don't do it all that money. I'll take that eye can. Amage crit, or, which did you pick? Pick damage, but crit's off it. It's the one I hate the most too. He's an asshole. Pretty sure they elope that comes before the actual boss. He's slightly weaker than the boss. He's a little easier to kill. He's already dead, at least. I hate these fucking grubs. They're less. Oh, really? You, but it's gonna say we can try and park for it. I'll just clear it, meaning that my chest. So I'll take what I've been doing. But then I still have damage. I should take damage. I don't know if I'm gonna do enough for demolition, but we can try it. I know, I've got piercing, so I need to get help sometimes. We'll probably, we'll do it later. Nice to, pretty much. Almost all of them done. We want them to back. Easy, easy. You better, uh, do you want glue explosion? Could be good. I'm gonna go for a con. Sorry, I can have some money. Yeah, I mean, yes. Cause I'm prox multiple times. I could get multiple money shots off on the sink. I don't think the target, which is quite good. I think that's the best range though. I can fire thing, though. Best how? The small gems over here, somebody over here. Crossbow kind of has too much fucking spread. I'm hardly hitting this thing. When you zoom in, it tightens the spread more. I never zoom in though, but I guess I'll have to. Yeah, that's kind of the heavy over film. But if you go to like a fire chop build, then having a big shot. You check, or Tony's black color. Do you? I've got mine gives us more. So Tony's black card will benefit us more technically. We can value. Oh, we both have the same amount. Oh, yeah. Do you want to get it? Uh, we'll help you out. That as well. I'll have that. I'll give you the rest of the money. Yeah, I'll just still more damage from the fire. I'll get crystal fertilizer. So if we get health crystals, we can get more. Good call. And also more money crystals, of course. Stop aiming for me. You asked me. Oh, it's got a vendetta against me. Yeah, you'll get them. No, you can get a scatter shot. It's blue. See. Oh, green repo. And it octane blasts. I should feel like I should go green repo.
